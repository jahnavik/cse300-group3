## Introduction ##

The **ER Diagram and Relational Model** was the third deliverable.

The Entity â€“ Relationship model (ER model) is an abstract way to describe a database. It is very useful in mapping the meanings and interactions of real-world enterprises onto a conceptual schema. The ER data model employs three basic concepts: entity sets, relationship sets, and attributes.

The Relational Model is a way to make database management systems more independent of any particular application. It is a mathematical model defined in terms of predicate logic and set theory. The basic data structure of the relational model is the table, where information about a particular entity is represented in rows (also called tuples) and columns. The columns enumerate the various attributes of the entity, and a row is an actual instance of the entity that is represented by the relation. Various relationships between and within entities are represented through cardinalities, keys and indices.

All Inputs obtained during the presentation have been compiled and will be put to use for the remaining deliverables as well.
