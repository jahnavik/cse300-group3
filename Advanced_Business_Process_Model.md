## Business Process Model ##

Business Process Modeling (BPM) is the activity of representing processes of an enterprise, so that the current process may be analyzed and improved. Business Process Modelling is a means of representing the steps, participants and decision logic in business processes.

There are three main types of process models:

1. Descriptive Models: Written Explanation of the Process.

2. Active Models: Working Model that represents the process (Eg. Computer simulations).

3. Diagrammatic Models: A Diagram representing the processes and relationships between them (Eg. Process Map, Flowcharts).


## Business Process Map ##

It refers to activities involved in defining exactly what a business entity does, who is responsible, designing new procedures, to what standard a process should be completed, and how the success of a business process can be determined.
