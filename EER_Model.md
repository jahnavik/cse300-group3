## Enhanced Entity-Relationship Model ##

### _Version 1.0_ ###

The basic **EER Diagram** for smarTAlloc is ready! It is a high level data model which incorporates extensions to our original **ER Model**.
It helps us to visualize the backend for our website - _smartalloc!_ more clearly and reflects the properties and constraints of the database.
