## Details ##

B.Tech/M.Tech/PhD TA(s) were identified by us and interviewed personally and were asked questions from the questionnaire which we had provided earlier.

We have also provided this **survey** for the TA(s) who currently don't have the time for separately discussing the Allocation Process.
