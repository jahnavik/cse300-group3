#summary Detailed Description of the Business Process Model for smarTAlloc!

= Software Development =

A software development process, also known as a software development life-cycle, is a structure imposed on the development of a software product. A typical software development process has these basic stages:

1. Planning and Design

2. Implementation, Testing and Documenting

3. Deployment and Maintenance

== Documenting ==

Documenting the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement is done throughout development. The software engineering process chosen by the developing team will determine how much internal documentation (if any) is necessary. Plan-driven models generally produce more documentation than Agile models.
