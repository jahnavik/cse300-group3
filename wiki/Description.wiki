== Introduction ==

We are aiming to create a structure for a current complex and prolonged process - the TA allocation process in IIIT-Delhi.

== Details ==

The allocation of teaching assistants for all specified courses is a tedious job for the coordinators and the TAâ€™s as well as it is currently being done manually in a very disorganized manner (via e-mails and Excel) and creates a lot of confusion. So, it is necessary to move towards a new, more efficient approach to the TA allocation process if we are to attain excellence in teaching at IIITD.

We are trying to reform the whole practice by creating a software to sort this problem wherein all the eligible and aspiring candidates will come across on a common open platform to know about the status of the current updated allocation and can easily know about their duties, time-table, work expected as the TA for a particular subject before applying for it.

_With our product, we aim to prioritize all the applications for TA-ship, allocate the proper course to well deserved candidates judiciously and in a SMARTER, more organized and sophesticated manner._
