## Entity-Relationship Model ##

In software engineering, an Entity â€“ Relationship model (ER model) is an abstract way to describe a database. It was developed to facilitate database design by allowing specification of an enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database. It is very useful in mapping the meanings and interactions of real-world enterprises onto a conceptual schema.
The ER data model employs three basic concepts: entity sets, relationship sets, and attributes. The E-R model also has an associated diagrammatic representation, the **ER Diagram**.
